# ðŸ˜¶ Wordcel

`wordcel` is a library of functions that provides a set of common tools for working with large language models.

Candidly, it is mostly a set of functions that I myself use on a regular basis -- my own personal Swiss army knife. 

## Installation

You can simply `pip install wordcel`.
